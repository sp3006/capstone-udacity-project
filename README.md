# Udacity Provided Project
    In the Udacity provided project, you'll work with four datasets to complete the project. The main dataset will include data on immigration to the United States, and supplementary datasets will include data on airport codes, U.S. city demographics, and temperature data. You're also welcome to enrich the project with additional data if you'd like to set your project apart.

# Title: Analysing the immigration data using I-94 immigration records 

## Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data

    As a part of this udacity provided project we will analyze the immigration data using the I-94 immigration record. The I-94 record stores various    information about immigrants. It lists the traveler’s immigration category, port of entry, data of entry into the United States, status expiration date and had a unique 11-digit identifying number assigned to it. Its purpose was to record the traveler’s lawful admission to the United States
## Data Gathering
I94 Immigration Data: This data comes from the US National Tourism and Trade Office. A data dictionary is included in the workspace. This is where the data comes from. There's a sample file so you can take a look at the data in csv format before reading it all in. You do not have to use the entire dataset, just use what you need to accomplish the goal you set at the beginning of the project.
World Temperature Data: This dataset came from Kaggle. You can read more about it here.
U.S. City Demographic Data: This data comes from OpenSoft. You can read more about it here.
